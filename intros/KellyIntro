Hey all
I'm Kelly, I'm a 2nd year WCC student studying Computer Science hoping to transfer to EMU after the end of this semester
After this semester I will have completed my Associates in Comp Sci and hope to get a job in the industry soon. 
As far as outside hobbies go, I like running and hiking as well as listening to podcasts and playing video games with friends.
