Hello! I’m Latitude, or Lat for short, I love Pusheen, cute things, making robots, and my pronouns are they/them/theirs. 
I am pursuing a bachelor’s in Computer Science (transferring from WCC) and then a graduate degree in library science with a concentration in data science. 
I would like to be a librarian after I graduate.
